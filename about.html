            Hi! My name is Adriana and I'm the human behind the amazing cakes you saw!
        </p>

        <p class="simpleParagraph">
            My story along with the story of my beloved "Granny's Taste" confectionery 
            all begins in Romania, where I was born, and more specifically in my grandma's summer kitchen. You see, 
            she was known in the village for her amazing sweets, and she was adored for it. I would spend hours
            upon hours by her side, carefully watching her every step, and while she never let me touch her
            work in progress (no one but her was ever allowed to!), she would tell me everything she was doing. 
        </p>

        <div class="ownerCooking">
            <img src="adrianaCooking.jpg" alt="owner of the confectionery cooking">
        </div>

        <p class="simpleParagraph">
            Ever since then, I promised myself I would learn everything she was doing, and keep her recipes 
            alive for generations. As I was growing up, I started writing everything she was teaching in notebooks that I kept.
            Those notebooks are now marked as "Top Secret", and stored in a safe in the back of our confectionery kitchen! :) 
        </p>

        <p class="simpleParagraph">
            As for keeping the tradition alive, my employees receive vigorous trainig sessions, and I am always there to
            make sure the recipes are followed, the secrets are kept, and amount of love put in each dessert is just the
            right amount. But perhaps my most important helper is my lovely son, without whom I couldn't have gotten where 
            I am today. 
        </p>
